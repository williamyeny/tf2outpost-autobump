*WARNING: this is a proof of concept, not an actual tool. I take no responsibility if you get banned.*

This is script you can paste into your web browser's console to automatically bump your trades. To do so, navigate to your trades page, open up the console (varies from browser to browser), paste it in and hit enter.

A previous script like this of mine was written in Ruby.
